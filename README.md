# HW3-multiplicationtables
I Started creating this project from friday and i have pretty good understanding of javasrcipt.
I think there is some fault with either me using mackbook and safari or something petty.
Becuase i watched the videos on how to do stuff and it was not that hard in console too.
The fact that it does not even print the simpliest code means there is something wrong somewhere.
